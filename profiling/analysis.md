## Profiling and Potential Improvements

* Dense MLP Kernel:
The profiling of the MLP kernel on an NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU, executed in 357.76 µs over 417,318 cycles at 1.17 GHz, reveals 11.53 M kernel instances (1.08 M global), with memory traffic showing 125.22 MB in L1/TEX cache (6.72% hit rate), 4.19 MB in L2 cache (97.60% hit rate), 3.26 MB in device memory, and 10.49 M shared memory requests, indicating heavy global memory reliance and poor L1 data locality despite the matmul_tiled_kernel using a 16x16 tile size to optimize memory access; this suggests potential improvements like adjusting tile size, enhancing coalesced access, or tuning thread blocks to reduce the 1.08 M global instances and improve the L1 hit rate.

* MOE Expert Kernel:
The profiling of the MoE expert MLP kernel (moe_expert_mlp_kernel) on an NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU, executed in 34.08 µs over 39,377 cycles at 1.15 GHz, shows 526.34 K kernel instances entirely from global memory (525.31 K requests), with memory traffic of 15.32 MB in L1/TEX cache (54.2% hit rate), 65.54 KB in L2 cache (83.09% hit rate), and 2.63 MB in device memory, alongside minimal system memory usage (36.74 KB); the kernel's sequential matrix multiplication loop for per-token expert dispatching, processing 1.58 M elements with a 16x16 thread block, indicates better L1 cache utilization than the dense MLP kernel 

* MOE Top 1 Router Kernel:
The profiling of the max_reduction_top1_kernel on an NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU, executed in 7.36 µs over 8,371 cycles at 1.13 GHz, shows 6.14 K global kernel instances (4.10 K requests) and 66.60 K shared memory instances (37.22 K requests), with memory traffic of 524.29 KB in L1/TEX cache (4.71% hit rate), 61.79 KB in L2 cache (23.50% hit rate), and 640.00 B in device memory, alongside no compression or peer memory usage; the kernel's efficient use of shared memory for parallel reduction within blocks (up to 512 threads) to select the top-1 expert per token is evident, but the low L1/TEX and L2 cache hit rates suggest limited data reuse, indicating potential optimization opportunities through improved data locality or adjusting block sizes to better align with the 64-thread configuration and reduce global memory dependency.
